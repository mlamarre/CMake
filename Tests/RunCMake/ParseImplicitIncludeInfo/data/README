This directory contains sample input files for the implicit include
directories parser for testing.  For each configuration there is one
".input" file and one ".output" file.

To generate ".input" files for a system, create a temporary build
directory and chdir to it.  Then run cmake pointing to this directory.
The CMakeLists.txt file here will generate ".input" files in your
build directory.

The ".output" files should be generated by hand from the input files.
The test will compare the parser output to the manually generated
".output" file.  The two should match.
